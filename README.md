This will be a basic calculator with divide/multiply/subtract/add functions.

To do:
First the calculator layout will be built in html/css.

***********************

Buttons 0-9 will be made clickable.
Then the input/outfield needs to become functional with the input (first value) stored in a variable.

Other buttons will be made clickable and second value can be added by user in input field.
Clicking '=' or one of the calculation buttons will show a result in the output field
result value = value one - so further calculations can be made unless clear button is hit
