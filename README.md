Calculator - README

This will be a basic calculator with divide/multiply/subtract/add functions.

First the calculator layout will be built in html/css.


***********************
  |input/output field| 

  7    8    9    backsp
                 / 
  4    5    6    
                 x
  1    2    3    
                 -
  0    .    =    
                 +

       clear
***********************

Buttons 0-9 will be made clickable. <i>done</i>
Then the input/outfield needs to become functional with the input (first value) stored in a variable. <i>done</i>

Other buttons will be made clickable and second value can be added by user in input field. <i>done</i>

Clicking '=' or one of the calculation buttons will show a result in the output field <i>done</i>

result value = value one - so further calculations can be made <i>done</i>

Still to do:
visualize which operator button has been clicked
make a 'clear all' button 
set a maximum length for the numbers in the display
more styling
